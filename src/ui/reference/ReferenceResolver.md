I'll start implementing the core functionality one file at a time, explaining each file's purpose and noting any changes to the requirements specification.

Let's begin with the first and most important file - the ReferenceResolver module:



I've created the `ReferenceResolver.ts` module, which is the foundation of our implementation. This module handles all aspects of token references following Style Dictionary principles.

## Purpose

This file provides comprehensive functionality for working with design token references:

1. **Reference identification and extraction**: Detecting and parsing references from token values
2. **Token map building**: Creating a flattened map of all tokens for efficient reference resolution
3. **Reference resolution**: Resolving references to their actual values, including nested references
4. **Reference chain tracking**: Building reference chains for future visualization
5. **Token processing**: Enhancing token data with reference information

## Key Features

- **Style Dictionary compatibility**: Uses the same `{reference.path}` format as Style Dictionary
- **Flexible path resolution**: Supports both dot notation (colors.primary.500) and slash notation (colors/primary/500)
- **Nested reference handling**: Resolves multi-level references (references that point to other references)
- **Circular reference detection**: Prevents infinite loops when resolving circular references
- **Reference chain building**: Tracks the full chain of references for future visualization
- **Fuzzy matching**: Includes basic fuzzy matching to find the best match for references

## Future Feature Support

I've included groundwork for our future objectives:

1. **Reference chain visualization**: The `chain` property in the `ResolvedReference` interface tracks all tokens in a reference chain
2. **Style Dictionary output documentation**: The module preserves all data needed for different output formats

## Implementation Note

I've made one addition to the original requirements: I've included reference chain tracking logic from the start, rather than saving it for a future implementation. This decision provides better support for debugging and will make the future reference chain visualization feature easier to implement without requiring significant refactoring.

Next, I'll create the `TokenCard.ts` component that will use this resolver to display tokens with proper reference information.
